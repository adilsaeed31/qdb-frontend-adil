# QDB Frontend Test by Adil

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Information

### I attempted to address each point outlined in the test documentation and included a basic sidebar test to confirm the proper rendering of the user name. 

### Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to replicate the UI exactly as shown in the test documentation image. My primary emphasis was on ensuring the functionality.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
